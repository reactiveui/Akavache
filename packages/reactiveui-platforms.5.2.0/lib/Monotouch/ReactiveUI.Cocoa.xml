            <summary>
            This class provides notifications for Cocoa Framework objects based on
            Key-Value Observing. Unfortunately, this class is a bit Tricky™, because
            of the caveat mentioned below - there is no way up-front to be able to
            tell whether a given property on an object is Key-Value Observable, we
            only have to hope for the best :-/

            Provides a scheduler which will use the Cocoa main loop to schedule
            work on. This is the Cocoa equivalent of DispatcherScheduler.

        <member name="T:ReactiveUI.Cocoa.RoutedViewHost">
            <summary>
            RoutedViewHost is a helper class that will connect a RoutingState
            to an arbitrary NSView and attempt to load the View for the latest
            ViewModel as a child view of the target. Usually the target view will
            be the NSWindow.
            This is a bit different than the XAML's RoutedViewHost in the sense
            that this isn't a Control itself, it only manipulates other Views.

            <summary>
            TargetActionCommandBinder is an implementation of command binding that
            understands Cocoa's Target / Action Framework. Many controls in Cocoa
            that are effectively command sources (i.e. Buttons, Menus, etc),
            participate in this framework.

            ViewModelViewHost is a helper class that will connect a ViewModel
            to an arbitrary NSView and attempt to load the View for the current
            ViewModel as a child view of the target.
            This is a bit different than the XAML's ViewModelViewHost in the sense
            that this isn't a Control itself, it only manipulates other Views.
