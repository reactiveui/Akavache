            <summary>
            AndroidUIScheduler is a scheduler that schedules items on a running
            Activity's main thread. This is the moral equivalent of
            DispatcherScheduler, but since every Activity runs separately, you must
            assign RxApp.MainThreadScheduler to an instance of this at the start of
            every activity.

            <summary>
            This binding type converter uses the built-in WPF component model
            conversions to get a whole bunch of conversions for free. Unfortunately,
            these are pretty gutted on some other platforms like Silverlight.

            Because RxUI.dll is in a PLib, it doesn't have the SuperPowers it needs
            to be able to really detect whether it's in a unit test runner. This class
            is much better at it.

            to register otherwise.
