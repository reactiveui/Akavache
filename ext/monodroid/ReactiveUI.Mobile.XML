            ISuspensionHost represents a standardized version of the events that the

            an app has recently crashed, as well as the firs time the app has
            been launched. Apps should create their state from scratch.

            <summary>
            Sets up the default suspend resume behavior, which is to use the
            ISuspensionDriver to save / reload application state. Using this also
            requires you to register an IApplicationRootState that will create a
            new application root state from scratch.

            ISuspensionDriver represents a class that can load/save state to persistent
